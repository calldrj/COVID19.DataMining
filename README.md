### Motivation:    
1. Scrap raw data in a Wikipedia page for the U.S. COVID-19 cases in each of 50 states, 4 territories, and Washington DC    
2. Extract useful information from the raw data to obtain clean and interpretable data    
3.  Visualize the data in vivid graphic forms for easy understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.    
4. Use the post-processed datasets,  we build a Bayesian-inference model to predict the time-series Effective Reproduction Rate for the COVID-19 pandemic (project Effective.Reproduction.Rate)   

### The data is reliable because it is:      
1. Collected and updated daily from every Department of Health from 50 states, 4 US territories, and Washington DC.            
2. Consistent with the figures reported by CDC, Johns Hopkins University.

2. Fully covers all 55 U.S states and territories        
3. Features 3 categories: Confirmed Positive, Deaths, and Recovered
